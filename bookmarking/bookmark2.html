        <h3>Meaning of Cloud Computing</h3>
        <ul>
        Cloud computing is a technology that enables us to create, configure, and customize applications through an internet connection. It includes a development platform, hard drive, software, and database. In this Cloud Computing Tutorial, you will learn the basics concepts of cloud computing which include multiple service models, deployment models, the infrastructure of cloud computing, and virtualization in cloud computing. We have also covered the advanced concepts of cloud computing, which will help you to learn more depth about cloud computing.

        <h3>What is Cloud Computing?</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>
            The term “Cloud Computing” generally refers to the ability of a system to store data or applications on remote servers, process data or applications from servers, and access data and applications via the Internet. Cloud computing provides scalability, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and security to individuals and organizations to manage their IT operations. Cloud computing works on a Pay-on-Use basis for individuals and organizations. It is an on-demand availability of system resources and computing power without direct active management by the user.

        <h3>History of Cloud Computing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In this, we will discuss the history of Cloud computing. And also cover the history of client server computing, distributed computing, and cloud computing.
            <li>Before Computing was come into existence, client Server Architecture was used where all the data and control of client resides in Server side. If a single user want to access some data, firstly user need to connect to the server and after that user will get appropriate access. But it has many disadvantages. So, After Client Server computing, Distributed Computing was come into existence, in this type of computing all computers are networked together with the help of this, user can share their resources when needed. It also has certain limitations. So in order to remove limitations faced in distributed system, cloud computing was emerged.</li>

        <h3>Advantages of Cloud Computing</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>
            It is easier to get backup in cloud.
        </li>
        <li>It allows us easy and quick access stored information anywhere and anytime.</li>
        <li>It allows us to access data via mobile.</li>
        <li>It reduces both hardware ad Software cost, and it is easily maintainable.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>It requires good internet connection.</li>
            <li>User have limited control on the data.</li>
