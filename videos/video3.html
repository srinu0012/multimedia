    <p>The lyrical scheme is that of traditional Tamil folk music – a string of multiple four-line stanzas bound by a common hook/chorus. And traditionally, folk stanzas have the same melody throughout. Now, AR Rahman being AR Rahman, gives this grammar a twist. He gives each stanza a different tune. Because the verses have a storyline-feel to them, it’s a prudent call to keep changing the tune in accordance with the change in emotion.
        Coming to another major aspect – the genre. “Adiye” is, by all means, a blues number. Fitting jazzy melodies into what looks like a folk song on paper is probably the USP of this song.
        A special mention to the killer opening and closing bits, which sway away from the syntax of the rest of the song. More on this later.</p>
